This is a CSS experiment incorporating **CSS Grid** and **CSS Variables**,
spawned by [a screenshot tweeted](https://twitter.com/mattbrailsford/status/867378544770502661)

When I see something like that, my mind goes into *"Oh, I wonder how I'd do that..."* mode, and I might as well
give it a try, 'coz it won't let me forget about it :-) Finally had some time on my hands to do it.

I'm of course curious to see how Matt did it - I know the markup is "just" an unordered list, but I was instantly intrigued by the
possible hazzles of getting the URL bit in there, not to mention getting the connecting lines in as well.

*This is a work in progress - need to add the **Home** node and the connections between the 1st level items.*
